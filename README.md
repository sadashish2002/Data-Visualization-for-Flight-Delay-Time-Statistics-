# Data-Visualization-for-Flight-Delay-Time-Statistics-
# Theme
Analyze flight delays in a dashboard.
# Pre-Requisite
* python3 -m pip install packaging
* python3 -m pip install pandas dash
* pip3 install httpx==0.20 dash plotly
* utilise an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) based on Theia (an open source IDE platform similar to VS Code) to develop and run Python code
# Dashboard Components
* Monthly average carrier delay by reporting airline for the given year.
* Monthly average weather delay by reporting airline for the given year.
* Monthly average national air system delay by reporting airline for the given year.
* Monthly average security delay by reporting airline for the given year.
* Monthly average late aircraft delay by reporting airline for the given year.


NOTE: Year range should be between 2010 and 2020

# Expected Output
Below is the expected result from the lab. Our dashboard application consists of three components:

* Title of the application
* Component to enter input year
* 5 Charts conveying the different types of flight delay. Chart section is divided into three segments.
* Carrier and Weather delay in the first segment
* National air system and Security delay in the second segment
* Late aircraft delay in the third segment


# To do:
* Design layout for the application.
* Create a callback function. Add callback decorator, define inputs and outputs.
* Review the helper function that performs computation on the provided inputs.
*Create 5 line graphs.
* Run the application.
